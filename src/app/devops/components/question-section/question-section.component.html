            Your consumers expect new and enhanced software solutions without
            having to wait. Your business must keep up to meet their
            ever-increasing demands. However, a lack of proper communication and
            collaboration between teams often leads to inefficiency, causing
            hindrances in the workflow. DevOps aims to encourage process
            automation and collaboration between the business, development, and
            operations teams for improved teamwork, seamless management,
            streamlined processes, and enhanced productivity. Departments that
            previously operated as separate entities now make use of technology
            to collaborate and reduce the system development life cycle
            immensely. Perception IT assists you in identifying your core
