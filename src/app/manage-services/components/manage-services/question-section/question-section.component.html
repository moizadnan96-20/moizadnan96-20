      • Keeping a service going 24 hours a day, seven days a week requires a
      team of IT professionals. That’s a team that must be recruited, trained,
      managed and then kept up to date with new trends and developments. Your
      team will have an on-call rota to handle problems that arise out-of-hours,
      but with a small team it’s likely that whoever is on call will not be the
      expert you need. They will have to call someone else, which will delay the
      fix even further.
    </p>
    <p class="body-2 padding-left padding-right">
      • MSPs remove that entire issue entirely. With a whole team of experts on
      hand, they can ensure that there is always a specialist monitoring your
      service. That allows them to get on with fixing a problem, whenever it
      occurs. And you, the customer, are not responsible for recruiting and
      training those people. Their training is covered by the service charge but
      that is spread among the MSP’s customers, so you are sharing a cost rather
      than shouldering it yourself.

      • You aren’t buying equipment, setting it up, maintaining it and
      dedicating precious office space to it. And don’t ignore the benefit of
      freeing up office space that was once taken up by servers, routers and
      other tin boxes. Imagine a law firm, for example, and consider how much
      more value they get from office space that has fee-earning lawyers in it,
      compared with space that’s devoted to IT.
    </p>
    <p class="body-2 padding-left padding-right">
      • MSPs can do this for less because they buy at a scale that brings costs
      down significantly. Moreover, the customer is buying only a piece of that
      equipment, so the costs are even lower.

      Adding new capabilities can add complexity, too. Having an MSP means
