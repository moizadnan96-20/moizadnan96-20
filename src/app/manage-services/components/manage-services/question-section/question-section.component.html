            Keeping a service going 24 hours a day, seven days a week requires a
            team of IT professionals who must be recruited, trained, managed and
            then kept up to date with new trends and developments.
            <br />
            Our managed service offerings remove these entire issue entirely.
            Our team of experts will ensure that there is always a specialist
            available to address any issues with your service.

          </h4>
          <p class="padding-right padding-left">
            The investment in specialist hardware and software will be high. A
            managed service offers the highest quality enterprise and carrier
            grade solutions to customers. A fixed monthly payment plan means you
            know what you’re going to get and how much it’s going to cost over
            the contract. No unexpected upgrade charges or changes in charges,
            guaranteed.

            services are constantly upgraded with no additional cost or

            Managed IT Service Providers can be extremely flexible; a
            pay-as-you-go payment plan allows for quick growth when necessary,
            or cost savings when you need to consolidate.

            By selecting managed services you gain access to staff with
            specialist skills. Sometimes you will only need this skill once, so
            save the expense of training your staff for skills they will never
            use. Redcentric have invested £100m in its infrastructure and is
            backed by one of best 24/7 x 365 technical support and operations
            team.

            Offloading IT means you no longer have to spend valuable hours
            managing IT when you could be growing your business. Never waste
            time trying to connect with multiple carriers about IT problems or
            invoices.
