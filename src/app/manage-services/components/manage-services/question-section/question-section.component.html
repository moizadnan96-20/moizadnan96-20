          <p>
            With a managed network you can benefit from the ability to
            centralise all your applications and servers within managed data
            centres, this leads to improved performance of staff, regardless of
            location. Access to centralised data centres within the network can
            also provide access to virtual services, as well as storage and
            backup infrastructure.
