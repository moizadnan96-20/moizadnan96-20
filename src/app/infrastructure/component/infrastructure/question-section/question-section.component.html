    <p class="body-2 padding-left padding-right">
      Performance hindrances can be caused by many factors including inadequate
      hardware support as well as upgrades not being performed in a timely
      manner. Having an Infrastructure support in place to ensure these
      activities are performed properly and timely can greatly reduce
      performance hindrances.
